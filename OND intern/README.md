# Weather Report Dashboard

A real-time weather monitoring dashboard built with Python, Streamlit, and the OpenWeatherMap API. This application provides interactive visualizations and detailed analysis of weather conditions across multiple cities.
Features
- Real-time weather data fetching from OpenWeatherMap API
- Interactive web dashboard using Streamlit
- Dynamic city management (add/view cities)
- Comprehensive weather analysis including:
  - Temperature comparisons
  - Humidity levels
  - Wind speed analysis
  - Weather condition tracking
- Interactive data visualizations using Plotly
- Detailed weather reports generation

Setup and Installation

1. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Set up OpenWeatherMap API:
- Get your API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
- The API key is already configured in weather_report.py

 Running the Application

1. Start the Streamlit dashboard:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

2. Access the dashboard:
- Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8501
- The dashboard will automatically fetch and display weather data

Project Structure

- `streamlit_app.py`: Main dashboard application
- `weather_report.py`: Core weather data fetching and processing
- `cities.txt`: List of cities to monitor
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies
- Generated files:
  - `summary_report.txt`: Detailed weather analysis
  - Various visualization plots

 Technical Approach

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Utilizes OpenWeatherMap API for real-time weather data
   - Supports multiple cities with dynamic addition
   - Handles API responses and error cases

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Converts raw API data into structured format
   - Calculates statistical metrics (averages, extremes)
   - Identifies weather patterns and conditions

3. **Visualization**:
   - Interactive Plotly charts for temperature and humidity
   - Seaborn/Matplotlib for statistical visualizations
   - Real-time data updates

4. **User Interface**:
   - Clean, intuitive Streamlit dashboard
   - Easy city management
   - Comprehensive weather insights

 Assumptions

1. **API Access**:
   - OpenWeatherMap API is accessible
   - API key has sufficient request quota

2. **Data Availability**:
   - Cities in the list are valid and recognized
   - Weather data is available for all cities

3. **System Requirements**:
   - Python 3.x installed
   - Internet connection for API access
   - Sufficient disk space for generated files

 Dependencies

Major dependencies include:
- streamlit
- pandas
- plotly
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- requests

See `requirements.txt` for complete list with versions.

 Error Handling

The application includes robust error handling for:
- API connection issues
- Invalid city names
- Data processing errors
- File I/O operations

 Future Improvements

Potential enhancements could include:
- Historical data tracking
- Weather forecasting
- Custom alert systems
